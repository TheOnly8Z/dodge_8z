# 8Z's Dodge System

A lightweight dodging and sliding system inspired by Warhammer 40k: Darktide. No binds or extra content required!

## How to Use
**Dodging**: While moving backwards or sideways on the ground, press your jump button to perform a dodge. This behaves like a sidestep or dash, quickly moving you in the direction while providing you brief invulnerability against damage.

**Sliding**: During a dodge or while sprinting, press your crouch button to enter a slide. Sliding carries you a short distance, while giving you a chance to evade bullet damage.

Dodging and sliding both consume your dodge meter. If you run out, your dodges and slides will become less effective and provide no invulnerability. Stop dodging or sliding for a moment for it to recover.

Many details about the addon can be configured in **Utilities -> 8Z's Dodge System**.
